## :rocket: About the Project

## :electric_plug: How to use

So when this project is cloned on your machine, it is necessary to install its modules using the package manager `YARN`...
If you do not have `YARN` properly installed on your machine, [access this link](https://yarnpkg.com/) to download and install...
If you already have `YARN` installed, open `terminal` (linux) or `cmd` (windows) at the root of the project where the `package.json` file is located and run the following command:

```
yarn
```

After that, `YARN` will install all the project dependencies for you...
The second step is to start the "backend" (Json-Server) of the project, for this I have already prepared a command in the script of the file `package.json`, just just run the following command:

```
yarn start_backend
```

Finally, we can start the project with the following command:

```
yarn start
```
